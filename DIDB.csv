There will be additional effort required for the changes based on the approaches identified and confirmed
",Proper data update won't happen in legacy system.  Overall delay on the migration activities,"Need to do analysis on the migration strategy and identify best approach.
Key factors considered are 
- No category information available in GDSN and how to route the appropriates messages to Legacy vs DAS
- Easiness of migration/Traceability of migrated items(was preferring category-wise migration)
- Less code changes Legacy
Based on initial analysis Architects identified few approaches. Need to further analyzed and discussed with business to confirm
Approach-1: Use GLN to category mapping –  GLN’s shared across category seems to be huge and don’t seem practical
Approach-2: GPC brickNbr to category mapping – business has concerns on building this mapping as the GPC hierarchy is new world. Legacy GDSN and DAS would have changes just for handling the DELETE publications 
Approach-3: Change the whole migration strategy to migrate items by vendorNbrs/GLN – Need further analysis as this would bring in design changes for data migration and ItemLink/CICS changes for offloading users.
